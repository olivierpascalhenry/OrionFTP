=========

To do list:
-----------
  - add folder download. (v0.8)

Limitations:
------------
  - as there is no clear command to abort a (S)FTP transfer, the solution put in place here is to close the connection, and open it again. Therefore, when canceling a download, a delay can occure as OrionFTP is closing connection and opening it again.
